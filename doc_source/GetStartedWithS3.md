# Getting started with Amazon Simple Storage Service<a name="GetStartedWithS3"></a>

Amazon Simple Storage Service \(Amazon S3\) is storage for the internet\. You can use Amazon S3 to store and retrieve any amount of data at any time, from anywhere on the web\. You can accomplish these tasks using the AWS Management Console, which is a simple and intuitive web interface\. 

To get the most out of Amazon S3, you need to understand a few simple concepts\. Amazon S3 stores data as objects within buckets\. An object consists of a file and optionally any metadata that describes that file\. To store an object in Amazon S3, you upload the file you want to store to a bucket\. When you upload a file, you can set permissions on the object and any metadata\. 

Buckets are the containers for objects\. You can have one or more buckets\. For each bucket, you can control access to it \(who can create, delete, and list objects in the bucket\), view access logs for it and its objects, and choose the geographical region where Amazon S3 will store the bucket and its contents\.
